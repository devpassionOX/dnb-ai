## About

This service powers the AI assistant inside **Deen Bridge**, a platform for authentic Islamic education built on the **Stellar network** — courses and books are purchased with USDC, and creators are paid directly to their own Stellar wallets. The assistant wraps Google's Gemini model with an Islamic-knowledge system prompt, content safety filters, and per-session conversation history, exposing a simple chat API consumed by the web app.

On the roadmap: Stellar-aware assistance — zakat calculation from a wallet's on-chain USDC balance via Horizon, and answering questions about the user's on-chain purchases (see the open `wave:*` issues).

The platform is composed of three services:

### Confidence, abstention, and scholar review

Every chat answer carries a documented 0–1 confidence score, and the service
acts on it rather than answering everything with equal certainty.

**The score** (one formula, in [`confidence.py`](confidence.py)) is a weighted
mean over whatever signals ran for that turn — a component that did not run
drops out of the average instead of being guessed at:

| Signal | Weight | Produced by |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `self_consistency` | 0.40 | the self-consistency work (#ai-18) — **passed in, never recomputed here** |
| `citation_verification` | 0.30 | citation verification (#40) — passed in the same way |
| `expressed_certainty` | 0.30 | derived here from the answer's own hedging language |

```
base   = Σ(wᵢ · sᵢ) / Σ(wᵢ)                     over signals present
capped = min(base, UNVERIFIED_CEILING)          if no external signal ran
score  = capped · (1 − HIGH_STAKES_PENALTY)     if the question is a high-stakes ruling
```

Two deliberate choices worth knowing:

- **High stakes is a multiplier, not a fourth signal.** It comes from intent
  classification and applies once — the same evidence should support less
  confidence when being wrong means issuing a wrong ruling. Counting it as both
  a signal and a modifier would double-count it.
- **Self-reported certainty cannot certify itself.** With no external
  corroboration the score is capped below the confident band, so a fluent answer
  that nothing checked gets hedged rather than waved through.

**The bands**, all configurable:

| Band | Score | Behaviour |
|------|-------|-----------|
| abstain | `< CONFIDENCE_LOW_THRESHOLD` | No answer. A pointer to a qualified scholar and authenticated sources. |
| uncertain | `< CONFIDENCE_HIGH_THRESHOLD` | Answers, with an explicit "please verify this" note attached. |
| confident | otherwise | Answers normally. |

**Scholar review.** Religious answers that land in the abstain band are
persisted to a durable queue (Redis when `REDIS_URL` is set — the same store
shape session persistence uses — in-memory otherwise, and **never** with a TTL:
a question waiting on a scholar must not expire unanswered). Low-confidence
*non-religious* answers are hedged but never queued; a scholar's time is for
religious content.

Reviewers list the queue and record a verdict:

```bash
curl -H "X-Review-Token: $SCHOLAR_REVIEW_TOKEN" localhost:8000/review/pending

curl -X POST localhost:8000/review/$ID/verdict \
  -H "X-Review-Token: $SCHOLAR_REVIEW_TOKEN" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"verdict": "correct", "corrected_answer": "…", "reviewer": "Shaykh …"}'
```

If Redis is configured but becomes unreachable, the queue keeps accepting items
into an in-process fallback and reports `degraded: true` from `/review/stats`
rather than failing chat turns — the loss of durability is made visible instead
of silent. Verdicts are claimed atomically, so two concurrent reviewers cannot
both record one and silently overwrite each other.

The reviewer endpoints are **closed by default** — without `SCHOLAR_REVIEW_TOKEN`
they return 503 rather than exposing users' pending questions.

Approved and corrected answers flow back through the two sinks that already
exist, not a new pipeline: the semantic cache (#27), and a JSONL export in an
eval-case shape at `REVIEW_EXPORT_PATH` for the eval set (#16) and feedback loop
(#43). Rejected answers are exported too — an answer a scholar caught is a
valuable eval case.

`ChatResponse` gains an optional `confidence: {score, band, abstained, queued,
signals, review_id}` block. It is additive; existing clients are unaffected.
### Tafsir (ayah explanation)

`POST /tafsir` explains an ayah from **named** tafsir works instead of from the
model's memory. Every passage is returned with the work, its author, and the
language the text is actually in — attribution comes from the source's own
response, never from the service's recollection of who wrote what.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/tafsir \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"reference": "103:1-3", "tafsirs": ["ibn-kathir", "tabari", "saadi"], "language": "en"}'
```

```jsonc
{
  "reference": "103:1-3",
  "language": "en",
  "ayat": [
    {
      "ayah": "103:1",
      "surah_name": "Al-'Asr",
      "arabic": "وَٱلْعَصْرِ",
      "translation": "By time,",
      "tafsirs": [
        {"key": "ibn-kathir", "name": "Ibn Kathir (Abridged)", "author": "Ibn Kathir (d. 774 AH)",
         "language": "english", "text": "…", "verse_range": "103:1-3"}
      ],
      "unavailable": [
        {"key": "qurtubi", "name": "Al-Jami' li-Ahkam al-Qur'an (Tafsir al-Qurtubi)",
         "author": "Al-Qurtubi (d. 671 AH)", "reason": "No entry for 103:1 in this tafsir."}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "disclaimer": "Tafsir text is retrieved verbatim from the works named above and is presented for study. …"
}
```

- **References** accept `103:1`, a range `103:1-3`, or a surah name (`Al-Asr 1-3`).
  Bounds are checked offline against [`data/quran/surah_index.json`](data/quran/surah_index.json),
  so `2:300` is a `400` naming Al-Baqarah's 286 ayat — never an invented verse.
- **Language**: tafsirs published in the requested language are served in it. A
  work with no such edition falls back to its original language and is labelled
  with it (set `allow_language_fallback: false` to omit it instead).
- **Degradation**: a work with no entry for the ayah appears under `unavailable`
  with a reason; the rest of the response is unaffected.
- **Latency**: ayat, and the works within an ayah, are fetched concurrently, and
  retrieval inside `/chat` is bounded by `TAFSIR_CHAT_TIMEOUT` — a slow upstream
  costs the turn its grounding, never its response.
- **Caching**: tafsir text is immutable per ayah, so it is cached by exact ayah
  key through `semantic_cache.KeyedCache` — the keyed sibling of the semantic
  response cache, sharing its TTL and eviction settings rather than adding a
  second cache system.

In `/chat`, a verse-explanation question ("what does Surah al-'Asr mean?",
"explain 2:255") is detected offline and answered from the same retrieved
passages, with the model instructed to attribute each claim to a named mufassir
and to surface — not flatten — points where the mufassirun differ. The response
carries a `tafsir` block naming the works whose text actually backed the answer.

### Zakat (on-chain, with a live nisab)

`POST /zakat` computes zakat on a wallet's on-chain USDC balance — 2.5% of the
whole balance once it reaches the nisab, nothing below it.

```bash
curl -sX POST http://localhost:8000/zakat \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"public_key": "GABC..."}'
```

**The nisab is live.** It is the value of **85g of gold**, so it moves with the
gold market and a hardcoded figure quietly goes wrong in both directions. It is
derived from a spot price fetched from [gold-api.com](https://api.gold-api.com/price/XAU),
falling back to CoinGecko's [PAX Gold](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pax-gold)
price (PAXG is redeemable one-for-one for a troy ounce of allocated gold) and
then to `ZAKAT_NISAB_USD`. Neither source needs an API key. The price is cached
for `NISAB_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS`, and a price outside a plausible range is refused
rather than used — a source that changes its units should degrade, not produce a
nisab off by an order of magnitude.

Every response reports where its threshold came from, so a live figure is never
mistaken for a stale default:

```jsonc
{
  "usdc_balance": "10000.0000000",
  "nisab_usd": "11112.17",
  "zakat_due": "0",
  "message": "Your USDC balance of 10000.0000000 is below the nisab threshold of 11112.17 USD (live gold price via gold-api.com), so no zakat is due on this balance alone.",
  "nisab": {
    "live": true,
    "source": "gold-api.com",
    "basis": "85g gold",
    "gold_price_usd_per_ounce": "4066.199951",
    "as_of": "2026-07-24T15:00:00+00:00"
  },
  "disclaimer": "This is an automated estimate based on your on-chain USDC balance only. ..."
}
```

Pass `nisab_usd` to override the threshold; the response then reports it as a
caller override rather than a market figure.

**In chat.** Asking a zakat question with a public key — "how much zakat do I
owe on my wallet GABC…?" — reads the real balance and answers with the actual
figures, keeping the scholar disclaimer. The key may also arrive in the request's
`context` field. Asking without a key gets an explanation of how zakat is
calculated and an invitation to share a **public** key. Detection is offline
(keywords plus a key-shaped match), so an ordinary message never touches Horizon
or the price API, and a zakat answer is never written to the response cache —
it contains one user's real balance. The answer carries a `zakat` block with the
figures used.

**Strictly read-only.** Only public keys are ever accepted; secret keys fail
validation like any other malformed input, so one can never reach Horizon. If a
message looks like it contains a secret key, the assistant refuses to use it and
warns the user to treat it as compromised — without repeating it back.

### Content-safety testing

The versioned policy lives in [`safety/policy.yaml`](safety/policy.yaml), with
review guidance in [`safety/POLICY.md`](safety/POLICY.md). Run the API-key-free
red-team suite with `pytest -q tests/redteam`. A manual live classifier audit is
available with `SAFETY_LIVE_TESTS=1 GEMINI_API_KEY=... pytest -q tests/redteam/test_live.py`.

## ☁️ Deployment

Deployed on [Render](https://render.com) via [`render.yaml`](render.yaml). CI runs lint and syntax checks on every PR (see [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)).
